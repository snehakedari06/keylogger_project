kEYLOGGER <br>

What Does This Project Do?
This is a basic keylogger that listens to all the keystrokes you press on your keyboard and logs them into a text file with timestamps. It helps you learn how keyloggers work and highlights the importance of cybersecurity.

Features
Tracks and logs every keypress, including letters, numbers, and special keys (like Enter or Space).

Logs each key with the exact time it was pressed.

Stores the logs in a file named keylogger_output.txt for easy access.

How to Set It Up
Install Python:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

Install the Required Library:

Open a terminal and run this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pynput
Save the Code:

Save the provided script as keylogger.py in your preferred folder.

Run the Keylogger:

Navigate to the folder in your terminal and type:

bash
Copy
Edit
python keylogger.py
Stop the Program:

To stop the keylogger, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

View the Logs:

Open keylogger_output.txt to see the keystrokes that were logged.

What Should the Logs Look Like?
Here’s an example of what you’ll find in keylogger_output.txt:
