kEYLOGGER <br>

What Does This Project Do?
This is a basic keylogger that listens to all the keystrokes you press on your keyboard and logs them into a text file with timestamps. It helps you learn how keyloggers work and highlights the importance of cybersecurity.
FEATURES:<br>
Tracks and logs every keypress, including letters, numbers, and special keys (like Enter or Space).

Logs each key with the exact time it was pressed.

Stores the logs in a file named keylogger_output.txt for easy access.
